# chatty
A plain bash script for reading PDF files with eSpeak

The script requires the PDF file to read as the first argument.
A specific eSpeak voice, e.g., "en" without quotes, can be passed as the second (optional) argument.

chatty will automatically ask for unsatisfied dependencies.
The output can be simply reproduced, or exported to a wav audio file and optionally converted to mp3.
